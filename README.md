## HOW TO PLAY:
* First, decide who goes first and what color each player will have
* Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn
* On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots
* The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row
 
## Model
* Data – what needs to be tracked/remembered
* To track – player1(red), player2(yellow) moves
* Pieces are dropped from the top
* If either color makes a vertical/horizontal/diagonal row of 4, player wins
